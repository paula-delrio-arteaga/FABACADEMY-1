## Project description: 

 - Create an artifact to visualize data on a piece of fabric in order to obtain an alive wearable piece. 
 
 - The material is "alive" in a sense, the data that's fed everyday leaves a residue that starts to emerge like patterns on the dyed fabric.

 - The residual patterns provide a way to log and contain information.
